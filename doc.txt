A split has developed in the word 'memory', between human memory, the kernel of collective and individual identity, and 'machine memory', an almost endless procession of dumb, blind dots. 

Our historical engagement with computers, confronting the truly new as a 'thinking machine', because thinking is familiar, and machines are familiar, provokes this sort of surgical chimera, where one concept is unhappily grafted onto the other. 




With all such dumb marks, whether cuneiform or binary, the gap between these two senses, 'the written record', and 'experience', is sewn together with an array of technical and social devices.



On the disc of a hard drive, 512 'machine words' form an arc thinner in width and shorter in length than a flagellum, 






Memory has come to straddle a gap, between human memory -- the kernel of collective and individual identity -- and machine memory -- the procession of dumb, blind dots, first spat out of punching machines, then induced into magnetic cores, then into the panopoly of today's memory devices: each different in their particulars, but identical in the abstract: [[you supply an 'address', and they return a 'word' at that adress.

If you took 512 of these 'machine words', stretched out in a line, a line on the disc of a hard-drive, thinner than a flagellum, only half so long.
